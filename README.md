# Why???
I started learning in a Chinese Institute. <br> So I taught "Why not build an app to teach me chinese?", and here we are. Also I'm kind of a nerd 🤓 <br>
I also built the same scraper in 7 programming languages 😮‍💨.

# How does It work?
okay, if you don't know what scraping is.<br>
Essentially scraping is getting the html document of a website and then getting the information needed by parsing that document
